# 🛡️ Malicious Tab Detector (AI-powered Chrome Extension)

This Chrome extension uses a **TensorFlow.js machine learning model** to detect potentially malicious browser activity such as:

- Excessive CPU usage  
- Suspicious network calls  
- High DOM mutation rates  
- Script injections  
- `eval()` abuse  
- Abnormal refresh rates  
- Hidden iframes  
- Memory spikes  

The AI model is trained in Google Colab and exported to TensorFlow.js.  
The extension loads this model and allows the user to **scan the active tab** for threats.

## 🚀 Features

### ✔ Machine-learning based malicious behavior detection  
The extension runs a TensorFlow.js model trained on 8 behavioral features.

### ✔ On-demand tab scanning via popup  
Click the extension and hit **Scan Active Tab**, and it predicts whether the tab is malicious.

### ✔ Browser-compatible telemetry framework  
The included feature extractor simulates telemetry (you can extend it later with real signals).

### ✔ Fully offline  
All inference is done inside the browser — no API calls, no cloud dependency.

## 🧠 The AI Model

The TensorFlow model is trained using an 8-feature malicious behavior dataset:

| Feature           | Description                             |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| cpu_usage         | CPU load from the tab                  |
| network_calls     | Number of outgoing network requests   |
| iframe_count      | Suspicious hidden frames               |
| refresh_rate      | Page reload loop detection             |
| dom_changes       | DOM mutation events                    |
| memory_usage      | JS heap size                          |
| script_injections | Unauthorized `<script>` insertions     |
| eval_calls        | Number of `eval()` invocations        |

After training, the model is exported to TensorFlow.js using:

tensorflowjs_converter --input_format=tf_saved_model malicious_tab_model tfjs_model


These files are then placed inside the `tfjs_model/` folder of the extension.

## 🧩 Installation (Chrome)

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open Chrome and go to:  
3. Enable **Developer Mode** (top right).
4. Click **Load Unpacked**.
5. Select the project folder `malicious-tab-detector/`.

Your extension is ready!

---

## 🕹️ Usage

1. Open any website.
2. Click the extension icon.
3. Press **Scan Active Tab**.
4. The popup will show:

- **🚨 Malicious Activity Detected!**  
- **✅ Tab is Safe**

This uses the AI model’s prediction threshold at `0.5`.

## 📦 Model Folder Requirements

Your `tfjs_model/` folder **must contain**:


These are automatically generated by Colab when exporting your trained model.

---

## 🛠️ Code Overview

### Background script (`background.js`)
- Loads TensorFlow.js model.
- Performs prediction when popup requests a scan.

### Popup (`popup.html` + `popup.js`)
- UI + user-triggered scan command.

### tabs_monitor.js
- Provides feature extraction (currently simulated).
- Can be replaced with real detectors (DOM watchers, network hooks, etc.).

---

## 📌 Future Updates (Optional Enhancements)

You can expand detection accuracy by adding:

### 🔥 Real Telemetry Extractors
- DOM MutationObservers  
- Network request listeners  
- iframe visibility trackers  
- JS heap usage metrics  
- Script injection detection  

### 🔥 Auto-scan every X seconds  
### 🔥 Block malicious tabs automatically  
### 🔥 Background threat logging system  
### 🔥 Heatmap of suspicious activity per domain
